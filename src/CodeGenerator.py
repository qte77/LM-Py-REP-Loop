"""
This module contains the CodeGenerator class, which generates Python code based on user prompts using a Large Language Model (LLM).

The CodeGenerator class:
- Provides a method to generate Python code from user prompts.
- Uses an LLM API to generate code, which is mocked in this implementation for testing purposes.

Classes:
    - CodeGenerator: Generates Python code based on user prompts.

Functions:
    - generate_code: Generates Python code from a given prompt.
