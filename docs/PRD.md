# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

This LLM-REPL Pipeline is a system designed to automate the process of code generation, evaluation, and refactoring using Large Language Models (LLMs), a Python REPL and CI/CD pipelines. This pipeline aims to enhance developer productivity by providing real-time feedback and iterative code improvement. Goals:

- Create a system where code can be generated, tested, and refined in real-time.
- Automate code generation from user prompts or requests.
- Provide immediate feedback on code correctness and efficiency.
- Enable iterative code refinement through a feedback loop.
- Ensure code quality through continuous testing and refactoring.

## Key Features

- Code Generation: Use LLMs to generate Python code based on user prompts.
- Code Execution: Execute generated code in a Python REPL to capture output and errors.
- Code Evaluation: Evaluate code for correctness, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.
- Code Refactoring: Refactor code based on feedback from the evaluation step.
- Feedback Loop: Implement a loop where code is generated, evaluated, and refactored until it meets predefined criteria.
- Version Control: Integrate with Git for tracking code changes.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Automate testing and deployment of code iterations.
- Security and Compliance: Ensure generated code adheres to security standards and compliance requirements.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to input a prompt or request, so that the system can generate code that meets my requirements.
- As a developer, I want the system to execute the generated code and provide feedback, so I can understand if the code works as expected.
- As a developer, I want the system to refactor the code based on feedback, so I can improve the code quality iteratively.
- As a developer, I want to see the history of code changes, so I can track the evolution of the solution.

## Technical Requirements

- LLM Integration: Use models like Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct, etc., from Hugging Face or Ollama.
- Python REPL: Use LangChain Python REPL tool or a custom REPL like "pai".
- CI/CD Pipeline: Implement using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
- Security: Integrate security scanning tools within the CI/CD pipeline.
- Documentation: Use arc42 for structuring architectural decisions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: The system should respond within 5 seconds for code generation and evaluation.

## Assumptions

- Users have basic knowledge of Python programming.
- The LLMs used are capable of generating Python code with high accuracy.

## Constraints

- The LLMs must be accessible either through an API or locally.

## Future Enhancements

- Conversational feedback loops to enhance the quality and speed of code generation.
- Reliability (optional): The system should have a 99.9% uptime.
- Scalability (optional): The pipeline should be able to handle multiple concurrent users.
