# User Story: Code Generation and Refactoring

**As a developer**, I want to input a prompt or request, so that the system can generate code that meets my requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system generates Python code based on the input prompt.
- The generated code is executed in a Python REPL.
- The system provides feedback on the code's correctness and efficiency.
- If the code fails or needs improvement, the system refactors the code based on the feedback.
- The loop continues until the code meets predefined criteria or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
- The user can view the history of code changes through version control.

## Tasks

- Integrate LLM API for code generation.
- Implement Python REPL for code execution.
- Develop a feedback loop for code evaluation and refactoring.
- Set up version control integration.
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
